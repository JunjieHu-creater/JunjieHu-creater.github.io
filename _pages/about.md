Hi, I'm Junjie Hu. I'm a second year master student from [School of Transport&Transportation Engineering](https://stte.csu.edu.cn/), [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes traffic spatio-temporal data analysis, explainable AI,deep learning and traffic safety.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jaeyoung Jay Lee]([https://www.XXX.com/](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jaeyoung-Lee-26)) of Spirit Lab from [School of Transport&Transportation Engineering, Central South University](https://stte.csu.edu.cn/). He is among the top 2% of scientists worldwide working on road safety.

You can find my CV here: [Junjiehu](../assets/JunjieHu_CV.pdf).
